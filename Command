C:>ping 
Ping is the most basic TCP/IP command, and it’s the same as placing a phone call to your best 
friend. You pick up your telephone and dial a number, expecting your best friend to reply with 
“Hello” on the other end. Computers make phone calls to each other over a network by using a 
Ping command. The Ping commands main purpose is to place a phone call to another computer on 
the network, and request an answer. Ping has 2 options it can use to place a phone call to another 
computer on the network. It can use the computers name or IP address.
C:>ipconfig
The ipconfig command displays information about the host (the computer your sitting at)computer 
TCP/IP configuration.
C:>ipconfig /all 
This command displays detailed configuration information about your TCP/IP connection 
including Router, Gateway, DNS, DHCP, and type of Ethernet adapter in your system.
C:>ipconfig /release
This command allows you to drop the IP lease from the DHCP server.
C:>ipconfig /renew 
Using this command will renew all your IP addresses that you are currently (leasing) borrowing 
from the DHCP server. This command is a quick problem solver if you are having connection 
issues, but does not work if you have been configured with a static IP address.
C:\>nbtstat –a
This command helps solve problems with NetBIOS name resolution. (Nbt stands for NetBIOS
C:\>arp –a
it is short for address resolution protocol, It will show the IP address of your computer along with 
the IP address and MAC address of your router.
C:\>hostname:
This is the simplest of all TCP/IP commands. It simply displays the name of your computer.
C:\>ipconfig /flushdns:
This command is only needed if you’re having trouble with your networks DNS configuration. 
The best time to use this command is after network configuration frustration sets in, and you really 
need the computer to reply with flushed.
C:\netdiag:
Netdiag is a network testing utility that performs a variety of network diagnostic tests, allowing 
you to pinpoint problems in your network. Netdiag isn’t installed by default, but can be installed 
from the Windows XP CD after saying no to the install. Navigate to the CD ROM drive letter and 
open the support\tools folder on the XP CD and click the setup.exe icon in the support\tools folder.
C:\>netstat:
Netstat displays a variety of statistics about a computers active TCP/IP connections. This tool is 
most useful when you’re having trouble with TCP/IP applications such as HTTP, and FTP. 
C:\>nslookup:
nslookup is used for diagnosing DNS problems. If you can access a resource by specifying an IP 
address but not it’s DNS you have a DNS problem.
C:\>pathping:
Pathping is unique to Window’s, and is basically a combination of the Ping and Tracert commands. 
Pathping traces the route to the destination address then launches a 25 second test of each router 
along the way, gathering statistics on the rate of data loss along each hop.
C:\>route:
The route command displays the computers routing table. A typical computer, with a single 
network interface, connected to a LAN, with a router is fairly simple and generally doesn’t pose 
any network problems. But if you’re having trouble accessing other computers on your network, 
you can use the route command to make sure the entries in the routing table are correct.
C:\>tracert:
The tracert command displays a list of all the routers that a packet has to go through to get from 
the computer where tracert is run to any other computer on the internet.
